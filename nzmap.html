I'll help you outline a process for creating an interactive map of New Zealand using territorial authority boundaries. Here's what you'll need:

Data Sources:
Stats NZ provides Geographic Boundary Files as shapefiles through their Geographic Data Service
You'll specifically want the Territorial Authority boundaries
The data is available in multiple formats including GeoJSON, which works well for web mapping
Implementation Approach:
Use a JavaScript mapping library - Leaflet.js is a popular choice for this
Convert the Stats NZ shapefile data to GeoJSON if needed
Set up an HTML file that includes:
The map library
A container for the map
Your custom JavaScript code
Here's a basic implementation structure:


Interactive New Zealand District Map
Click to open website
To make this work with actual data, you'll need to:

Download the data:
Go to Stats NZ Geographic Data Service
Download the Territorial Authority boundaries
Convert to GeoJSON format if needed (you can use tools like QGIS or mapshaper.org)
Modify the code:
Replace the commented fetch section with your actual GeoJSON data
Adjust the getColor function to match your data ranges
Customize the popup content based on your needs
Additional features you might want to add:
A legend explaining the colors
Additional data layers
Custom styling for different zoom levels
Search functionality
Different base maps
Would you like me to explain any part of this in more detail or help you with implementing specific features?

im looking at this site and im not sure what to download

Territorial Authority 2023 (generalised) | Stats NZ Geographic Data Service


Let me help you navigate the Stats NZ Geographic Data Service download options.

On the Territorial Authority 2023 page, you'll want to look for the download options. For making a web map, the best format would be GeoJSON, as it works directly with web mapping libraries like Leaflet.

When downloading, look for a file that says "GeoJSON" in the format options. It might be named something like "territorial-authority-2023-generalised.geojson". The "generalised" version is perfect for web mapping as it has simplified boundaries that will load faster.

If you don't see GeoJSON as an option, you can also download the shapefile format (look for .shp extension) and convert it. Would you mind copying the exact download options you're seeing? That way I can guide you to the best choice for your needs.

Also, if you're seeing multiple coordinate system options (like NZTM2000 or WGS84), choose WGS84 as it's the standard for web mapping.

these are my options

I see you're looking at the download options for the NZ Territorial Authority data. Since there isn't a direct GeoJSON option available, I recommend downloading the "Shapefile" format. This is actually a set of files that come packaged together in a ZIP file.

Looking at your screenshot, you should:

Keep "NZGD2000 / New Zealand Transverse Mercator 2000" as the coordinate system
Select "Shapefile" from the dropdown
Click "Create Export" button (it shows the file will be about 9MB)
After downloading, you'll get a file named "statsnz-territorial-authority-2023-generalised-SHP.zip". You'll need to convert this to GeoJSON format for web use. There are a few ways to do this:

Use an online converter like mapshaper.org:
Go to mapshaper.org
Drop your unzipped shapefile (all the files that came in the ZIP)
Click "Export" and choose "GeoJSON" format
Or use QGIS (free GIS software):
Open the shapefile in QGIS
Right-click the layer
Choose "Export" > "Save Features As..."
Select "GeoJSON" as the format
Would you like me to help you with the conversion process once you have the shapefile downloaded?

looks like i cant export unless i sign up to Koordinates


Ah yes, you'll need a free Koordinates account to download the data from Stats NZ Geographic Data Service. Koordinates is the platform Stats NZ uses to distribute their geographic data.

Here's what you need to do:

Click "Sign Up" on the Koordinates site
You can sign up with an email address or with a Google/GitHub account
Once signed up and logged in, you'll be able to:
Return to the Territorial Authority dataset
Select your download options (Shapefile format as we discussed)
Click "Create Export" to download
The signup is free and pretty straightforward. Would you like me to help you with the next steps once you've created an account and downloaded the data? I can guide you through converting the shapefile to GeoJSON and implementing it in the map we discussed earlier.

in the zip file there was one .shp file and ive converted that to geo json


Great! Now that you have the GeoJSON file, let's modify the earlier HTML map to use your actual NZ territorial authority data.


New Zealand District Map with Local GeoJSON
Click to open website
To use this:

Save this HTML file in the same directory as your GeoJSON file
Update the fetch line with your GeoJSON filename:
javascript

Copy
fetch('your-geojson-file.geojson')
You'll need to serve these files through a local web server because browsers restrict loading local files directly. You can do this by:
Using Python's built-in server: python -m http.server
Using VS Code's Live Server extension
Or any other local web server
Currently, the map assigns random colors to each territory (for demonstration). Would you like to:

Color the territories based on specific data?
Add more information to the popups?
Customize the styling in any way?
Also, you might get a CORS error if you try to open the HTML file directly - would you like me to explain how to set up a simple local server to avoid this?

im got my geojson file but i cant upload to git because its over 25mb



2 / 2

Ah yes, GitHub has a file size limit of 25MB for individual files. There are a few ways to handle this:

Use Git LFS (Large File Storage):
Install Git LFS
Set up LFS tracking for your GeoJSON file
This allows you to store large files on GitHub
Simplify the GeoJSON to reduce its size:
Go to mapshaper.org
Upload your GeoJSON file
Use the "Simplify" tool (try 10-20% simplification)
Export as GeoJSON This will reduce detail in the boundary lines but keep the essential shape, making the file smaller
Host the data elsewhere:
Use a service like AWS S3
Or use a data hosting service like Kaggle Datasets
Would you like me to walk you through any of these options? The simplification route using mapshaper is probably the quickest solution if you don't need extremely detailed boundaries.

what setting should i use

For a web map of territorial authorities, use the "Visvalingam / effective area" method (which you already have selected) - this is a good choice! This method removes points that create small triangles, which works well for preserving the overall shape of territorial boundaries while reducing file size.

Try these settings:

Keep "Visvalingam / effective area" selected
Use the slider to set around 10-15% simplification initially
Click "Apply" and check if the boundaries still look good
If the file is still too large, you can increase the simplification percentage
If the boundaries look too rough, decrease it
The key is to find a balance where the boundaries still look clean but the file size gets under 25MB. You can see the file size when you export - try exporting after each simplification to check if it's under the GitHub limit.

Would you like me to help you evaluate the results once you've applied the simplification?

great that works. can you now write me a nzmap.html that pulls this data in and display it as an out line of a map and when you click a sectoin it fills in light blue and when you click it a second time it clears



Interactive NZ Map with Click-to-Fill
Click to open website
To use this:

Save this as nzmap.html in the same directory as your GeoJSON file
Update the fetch line with your actual GeoJSON filename
Serve it through a local web server (like python -m http.server or VS Code's Live Server)
This map will:

Show all territorial authorities as outlines
Fill an area light blue when clicked
Clear the fill when clicked again
Show a subtle hover effect on unselected regions
Maintain the selected state of multiple regions
You can customize it by:

Changing the fill color (replace '#add8e6' with any color code)
Adjusting the opacity (change fillOpacity value)
Modifying the hover effect
Adding popups with region names
Would you like me to help you customize any of these aspects?

the file is called 

territorial-authority-2023-generalised.json

and is in the same location as the html file. important to note im hosting this on git



2 / 2

If you're hosting this on GitHub, we'll need to adjust the path to use the raw GitHub URL format. However, since you mentioned the file is in the same location as the HTML file in your repository, let's first try with the direct filename and make sure it works with GitHub Pages.


Interactive NZ Map for GitHub Pages
Click to open website
Key changes made:

Updated the fetch path to match your filename exactly
Added error handling for the fetch request
Added popups showing region names on click
Added some basic body padding for better presentation
Improved error messaging if the file fails to load
If you're hosting this on GitHub Pages:

Make sure both files are committed to your repository
Enable GitHub Pages in your repository settings (usually under Settings > Pages)
The site should be available at https://yourusername.github.io/yourrepository/nzmap.html
If you run into any issues loading the data, we might need to:

Use the full GitHub raw URL for the JSON file, or
Adjust the relative path depending on your repository structure
Let me know if you need help with any of these aspects or if you run into any issues!

i get this

This error occurs because the JSON file isn't being parsed correctly. Let's check the JSON content to make sure it's valid. Add some diagnostic logging and error handling to identify the exact issue.


Interactive NZ Map with Error Handling
Click to open website
Could you help me debug by:

Opening your GeoJSON file in a text editor and checking the first few lines? The file should start with something like:
json

Copy
{
  "type": "FeatureCollection",
  "features": [
    {
      "type": "Feature",
      "properties": {
Could you also try pasting the first few lines of your GeoJSON file here? This will help us identify if there's any formatting issue.
The error suggests there might be an issue with the JSON format, which could happen if:

The file wasn't properly converted from shapefile to GeoJSON
There was an encoding issue during the conversion
The JSON structure isn't what Leaflet expects

here's a slice

{"type":"GeometryCollection", "geometries": [
{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[176.9889861996387,-39.858265048937746],[176.98900095072133,-39.85811556558296],[176.9888842173433,-39.85800519886691],



2 / 2

Ah, I see the issue - the GeoJSON file is using a "GeometryCollection" type instead of the "FeatureCollection" type that we need. We need to adjust our code to handle this format or convert the data structure. Let's modify the code to work with your specific JSON structure:


Interactive NZ Map for GeometryCollection
Click to open website
Key changes made:

Modified the code to handle GeometryCollection instead of FeatureCollection
Added conversion from GeometryCollection to FeatureCollection
Simplified the feature properties since we don't have the original properties
Added proper error handling
This should now work with your JSON file structure. The territories will be clickable and will fill with light blue when clicked, just as requested.

If you want to add names or other properties to the regions later, we can modify the code to include that data. Would you like me to show you how to add that information?

Also, if you're still having issues, could you try to access the JSON file directly in your browser to make sure it's accessible at the correct path?

great it works. what cause the lines that are outside the country in the water. id like to get rid of them


Those lines in the water are likely territorial boundaries that extend into coastal waters - they represent the official maritime boundaries of each territorial authority. To remove them, we have a few options:

We can clip the boundaries to the coastline
We can add a mask (a white or blue overlay) over the ocean areas
We can adjust the zoom and pan limits to focus only on the mainland
Let's try the mask approach, as it's the simplest solution:


Interactive NZ Map with Ocean Mask
Click to open website
Key changes made:

Added a light blue ocean mask that covers the entire map area
Set map bounds to restrict panning to just the NZ area
Added zoom limits to prevent zooming too far in or out
Adjusted the base map opacity to make it less prominent
Added a light blue background color to help blend the ocean areas
The maritime boundaries will still be there technically, but they'll be less visible against the blue background. You can adjust the ocean color by changing the #b3d9ff color code to a different shade of blue if you'd like.

Would you like me to:

Adjust the ocean color to a different shade?
Modify the bounds to focus on a different area?
Show you how to completely clip the boundaries instead of masking them?

can you also make it a darker blue when i click on sections.

also important that it caches the selection data locally



3 / 3

I'll update the map with a darker blue selection color and add local storage to remember selections between page refreshes.


Interactive NZ Map with Local Storage
Click to open website
Key changes made:

Changed the selection color to a darker blue (#0066cc)
Added localStorage to persist selections between page refreshes
Added a "Clear All" button to reset selections
Increased the fillOpacity for selected regions to 0.7 for better visibility
Added a layersByFeatureId object to keep track of all layers for easier management
Made sure selections are restored when the page loads
The map will now:

Use a darker blue for selected regions
Remember which regions were selected even after closing and reopening the page
Allow you to clear all selections with a single button click
You can customize it further by:

Changing the dark blue color (modify the #0066cc color code)
Adjusting the opacity (change the fillOpacity value)
Modifying the clear button style
Adding export/import functionality for selections
Would you like me to adjust any of these aspects?

i really want the outside of new zealand removed, and ti want the map to be full screen and zoomed in on new zealand



2 / 2

I'll update the map to be full screen, better zoomed to NZ, and add a mask to hide the ocean boundaries.


Full Screen NZ Map with Coastline Mask

Key changes made:

Made the map truly full screen (100vh height)
Adjusted the zoom level and center point to better fit NZ
Added a background color to match the ocean
Added a simplified NZ coastline outline
Reduced the opacity of the base map
Added proper styling for the clear button
Removed any padding/margins that were taking up space
Adjusted the bounds to keep focus on NZ
The map should now:

Fill the entire screen
Be better focused on New Zealand
Hide most of the ocean boundaries
Look cleaner overall

Adjust the zoom level or center point?
Modify the ocean color?
Adjust the mask boundaries?

now it looks like this

I see what's happening - there's still a rectangular boundary visible around the coastline. Let's fix this by adjusting our masking approach to better match New Zealand's actual coastline.


Clean NZ Map with Proper Masking
Click to open website
Key changes made:

Removed the base map tiles completely
Removed the explicit masking layer
Set the background color to match the ocean blue
Adjusted the map to fit the actual boundaries of the GeoJSON data
Fine-tuned the zoom levels and bounds
Added zoomSnap for smoother zoom control
Removed any unnecessary overlays
The map should now:

Show only the actual NZ boundaries without the rectangular artifact
Have a clean ocean-blue background
Be properly zoomed to fit the country
Maintain all the selection functionality
